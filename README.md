requirement: golang installed, and vfio log  (dummy test log included)
  
follow [this](https://github.com/Crump3tte/bettermmiotrace) awesome guide by user crump3tte to set up passthrough of your device \:')  
  based on output generated by Simon's [verilog-generator](https://github.com/Simonrak/verilog-generator)   

  hopefully soon someone can come up with a better solution
  
## usage

profit :)  
  
## issues  
  
it is very possible you run into issues as i just tested it on my one device.  
create a github issue so it can be fixed :)
